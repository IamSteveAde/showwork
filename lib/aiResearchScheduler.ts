 * research is at least a week old.
 *
 * The daily check itself is cheap and just a database query; the
 * real cadence is enforced by aiLastResearchedAt, not by how often
 * this job happens to run. This is more robust against a missed or
 * delayed run than relying on a strict weekly cron schedule.
 *
 * Only calendars that already have a business summary are researched.
 * This means at least one business document has been uploaded and the
 * AI has existing business context to improve.
 *
 * AI Research is included in the Content Workspace subscription.
 * It does not consume the customer's monthly interactive AI generation
 * or regeneration allowance because this is an internal scheduled
 * background process.
