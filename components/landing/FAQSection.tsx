  {
    question: "What is Showwork?",
    answer:
      "Showwork is an intelligent marketing operations platform that helps businesses and marketing professionals bring together business knowledge, content planning, AI-assisted creation, collaboration, supported social publishing, customer conversations, and available performance insights in one connected workspace.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Showwork suitable for an existing marketing team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Marketing Workspace connects preparation, collaboration, supported execution, and performance visibility. Your plan determines workspace capacity, collaborator limits, and access to advanced features.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we use our existing social accounts?",
    answer:
      "You can authorize supported accounts through Channels. Publishing, messaging, and analytics support differ by platform, account eligibility, and the permissions granted.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does AI help the team?",
    answer:
      "Available assistance includes business-context-based content preparation, inbox reply drafting, and performance-informed recommendations. Reply drafting and performance recommendations require Studio or Agency. AI allowances and service availability apply; your team remains responsible for decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does approved content publish automatically?",
    answer:
      "Auto-publishing can be enabled or turned off. A post must also meet its schedule, account permissions, media requirements, and any platform-specific consent rules. Approval alone does not guarantee publication.",
  },
  {
    question: "What analytics are available?",
    answer:
      "Basic analytics are included in each plan. Advanced analytics and AI performance recommendations require Studio or Agency. The metrics shown depend on the connected platform, account permissions, and available data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we manage conversations and leads?",
    answer:
      "Studio and Agency include Social Inbox and lead management for supported connections. Keep conversation history, contact details, notes, and lead status available for follow-up. This is not a complete sales CRM.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which plan should we choose, and can we try it?",
    answer:
      "Compare workspace capacity, collaborator limits, AI allowances, and included features in the pricing section. Marketing Workspace offers a seven-day trial with Agency feature access. You can also request a business demo by email.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Marketing Workspace different from Project Delivery?",
    answer:
      "Marketing Workspace supports ongoing marketing operations, from content preparation through supported publishing, conversations, and insights. Project Delivery is a separate product for presenting creative deliverables, collecting feedback, approvals, and project handovers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do we get started?",
    answer:
      "Create an account, set up a Marketing Workspace, add business context, and invite collaborators within your plan limits. Authorize supported social accounts through Channels when you are ready to connect publishing, messages, or reporting.",
  },
